# Learn Backend with Node.js - Journey ðŸš€

This repository is my personal learning journey of **Backend Development** using **Node.js**.  
I will update it **daily** with notes, code examples, and progress.

## ðŸ“… Daily Log

### Day 1 (Sep 6, 2025)
- Installed Node.js and set up the environment.
- Learned the **difference between Node.js and Browser**:
  - Browser runs JavaScript in the client (limited to DOM, window, etc.)
  - Node.js runs JavaScript on the server (no DOM, has modules like `fs`, `http`).
- Explored **Global Objects** in Node.js (`__dirname`, `__filename`, `require`, `process`).
- Practiced **`module.exports`** to share functions/variables across files.

### Day 2 (Sep 7, 2025)
- Learned about **Core Node.js Modules**:
  - `os` â†’ system info like uptime, user info, memory.
  - `path` â†’ file paths (`basename`, `dirname`, `join`, `resolve`).
  - `fs` â†’ File system module:
    - `readFileSync`, `writeFileSync` (synchronous methods).
    - `readFile`, `writeFile` (asynchronous methods with callbacks).
  - `http` â†’ created a basic web server with different routes (`/`, `/about`, etc.).
- Understood difference between **synchronous vs asynchronous** file operations.  

### Day 3 (Sep 8, 2025)
- Learned about **npm (Node Package Manager)**:
  - How to download and install npm packages.
  - How to import and use packages in Node.js projects.
  - Difference between local vs global packages.
- Installed and used **nodemon** globally to auto-restart the server.
- Studied the **Event Loop** in Node.js:
  - How Node.js handles asynchronous operations.
  - Difference between **synchronous** and **asynchronous** execution.
- Ran small experiments on localhost to see how **sync code blocks execution** but **async code runs without blocking**.

Day 4 â€“ Sep 9, 2025
Learned about Promises in Node.js:
How to convert callback-based functions to promises using new Promise().
How resolve and reject work.
Practiced chaining .then() and handling errors with .catch().
Explored async/await syntax:
Made asynchronous code look synchronous.
Used try/catch for error handling with async functions.
Practiced reading multiple files asynchronously using:
fs.readFile with callbacks.
Promisified fs.readFile using util.promisify.
Learned about EventEmitter:
Created custom events with .on() and .emit().
Understood event-driven programming in Node.js.
Experimented with combining async/await and EventEmitter to manage asynchronous events.
Reviewed file path management:
Ensured correct relative paths when reading files.
Used 'utf8' encoding to read text files as strings instead of buffers.
